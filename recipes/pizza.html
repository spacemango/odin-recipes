<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Pizza Dough</h3>
<ul>
   <li>1 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
   <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
   <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
   <li>3⅓ cups all-purpose flour</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
   <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
</ul>
<h3>Garlic Oil</h3>
<ul>
   <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pizza Toppings</h3>
<ul>
   <li>¼ cup tomato sauce, divided</li>
   <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes, divided</li>
   <li>¼ cup sliced black olives, divided</li>
   <li>¼ cup roasted red peppers, drained and chopped, divided</li>
   <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
   <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast
      softens and
      begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
   <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Turn onto a
      lightly
      floured surface. Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes. Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp
      cloth. Set
      aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. Set aside to rise for 1 more
      hour, or
      until doubled again.</li>
   <li>Meanwhile, make garlic oil: Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. Heat
      for 30
      seconds in the microwave.</li>
   <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
   <li>Make pizzas: Punch down dough and divide in half. Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
   <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom
      crust
      has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
   <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust; then top with 1/2 of each of the following: tomato sauce, chopped
      tomatoes, olives, red peppers, cheese, and basil. Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. Remove from grill and
      set
      aside to cool for a few minutes. Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
