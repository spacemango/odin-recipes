<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Middle Eastern foods rely on an abundance of spices and seasonings to create richly flavored food. Shawarma usually
   involves a stack of meat on a grill, but this recipe calls for a layer of chicken thighs on a sheet pan, in the oven.
   Use the broiler briefly, at the end of the baking time, to achieve extra flavor from the light char. Chicken can be
   served on steamed white rice, or sliced and served in a pita or flatbread with tomatoes, lettuce, and your favorite
   tzatziki or tahini sauce.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>â…” cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
   <li>2 medium lemons, juiced</li>
   <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
   <li>4 tablespoons finely minced fresh garlic</li>
   <li>4 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
   <li>4 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
   <li>2 teaspoons salt, or to taste</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
   <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
   <li>3 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
   <li>1 large onions, sliced 1/2-inch thick</li>
   <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
   <li>
      Combine olive oil, lemon juice and zest, garlic, smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground coriander, crushed red
      pepper
      flakes, salt, pepper, turmeric, and cinnamon in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and gently
      squeeze
      ingredients together until they are well blended. Add chicken thighs to the bag, squeeze out most of the air,
      seal,
      and
      refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 8 hours.</li>
   <li>
      Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a 12x18-inch baking sheet. Spread onion slices
      over
      the bottom; add chicken thighs on top.
   </li>
   <li>Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven, about 30 minutes. Switch on the broiler and move rack closer to
      the
      broiler. Broil chicken until a light char develops, 2 to 3 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
      center
      should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Garnish with parsley.</li>
